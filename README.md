Prim’s algorithm for computing Minimum Spanning Tree depends on two important functions

    a) Extract Min(Queue)
    b) Decrease Key(Vertex)

    i)  Write a program to create an undirected graph G consisting of N nodes such that the graph is connected.
        Each edge will have an integer edge weight in the range 1 to w.
            Input : N(number of vertices)
            Output : Connected Graph with N vertices and E edges.
      
    ii) Find MST of G using Prim’s algorithm.
